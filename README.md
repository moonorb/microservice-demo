# Microservice-Demo Application

This code can be used as a demo application for any OpenTelemetry project. There are 3 microservices which interact with each other. 

The original Java Code beleongs Paul Chapman's [GitHub](https://github.com/paulc4/microservices-demo) . This repo has some minor modifications from the original code so it can be converted into a microservice thus be deployed using Helm charts.
